This is my attempt at a personalised website..

I'm planning to make it aesthetic and include some cute little easter eggs (that are easily found)

https://momo-mollie.github.io/momo-page/

to add:
- in welcome page; make drawing of myself and add
- game: texts that once you hover over it shows previews of the game in the background
- hobbies list with clips of me/photos or something
