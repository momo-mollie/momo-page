This is my attempt at a personalised website..

I'm planning to make it aesthetic and include some cute little easter eggs (that are easily found)

to add:
- game: texts that once you hover over it shows previews of the game in the background
- more text and description for status icon
- hobbies list with clips of me/photos or something
